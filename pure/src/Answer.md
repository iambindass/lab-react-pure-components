The PureCounter.jsx component performs better than the SimpleCounter.jsx component because it utilizes the PureComponent class from React. When a class extends PureComponent, it only re-renders when its props (in this case, "toggle" and "count") have changed. However, SimpleCounter will re-render even if the props have not changed. By using PureComponent, unnecessary re-renders are avoided, resulting in better performance.
